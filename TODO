* More tests for inflate
* Immutabilization
** inflate/deflate
** _load_from_dbms list of keys & _load_from_key SQL
** share candidate key list between caching bits & _load_from_dbms
* Sugar for SQL generation - use example in Fey::ORM::Manual::Intro as guide
* Objects represent "potential" rows (data not yet in DBMS)
* TableClass->All()
** probably needs a default sort order or something as well
* has_many ( ..., via => $linking_table )
