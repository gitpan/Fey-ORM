NAME
    Fey::ORM - A Fey-based ORM

SYNOPSIS
    A "table-based" class for the User table:

      package MyApp::Model::User;

      use MyApp::Model::Schema;
      use Fey::Class::Table;

      my $schema = MyApp::Model::Schema->Schema();

      has_table $schema->table('User');

      has_one $schema->table('Group');

      has_many 'messages' =>
          ( table =>  $schema->table('Messages') );

    "MyApp::Model::Schema" might look like this:

      package MyApp::Model::Schema;

      use Fey::Class::Schema;
      use Fey::DBIManager::Source;
      use Fey::Loader;

      my $source =
          Fey::DBIManager::Source->new( dsn  => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=MyApp',
                                        user => 'myapp',
                                      );

      my $schema = Fey::Loader->new( dbh => $source->dbh() )->make_schema();

      has_schema $Schema;

      __PACKAGE__->DBIManager()->add_source($source);

    Then in your application:

      use MyApp::Model::User;

      my $user = MyApp::Model::User->new( user_id => 1 );

      print $user->username();

      $user->update( username => 'bob' );

DESCRIPTION
    "Fey::ORM" builds on top of other Fey project libraries to create an ORM
    focused on easy SQL generation. This is an ORM for people who are
    comfortable with SQL and want to be able to use it with their objects,
    rather than people who like OO and don't want to think about the DBMS.

    "Fey::ORM" also draws inspiration from "Moose" and tries to provide as
    much functionality as it can via a simple declarative interface. Of
    course, it uses "Moose" under the hood for its implementation.

EARLY VERSION WARNING
    This is still very new software, and APIs may change in future releases
    without notice. You have been warned.

    Moreover, this software is still missing a number of features which will
    be needed to make it more easily usable and competitive with other ORM
    packages.

GETTING STARTED
    You should start by reading Fey::ORM::Manual::Intro. This will walk you
    through creating a set of classes based on a schema. Then look at
    Fey::ORM::Manual for a list of additional documentation.
