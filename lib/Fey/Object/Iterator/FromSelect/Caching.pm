# ABSTRACT: A caching subclass of Fey::Object::Iterator::FromSelect

=head1 NAME

Fey::Object::Iterator::FromSelect::Caching - A caching subclass of Fey::Object::Iterator::FromSelect

=head1 VERSION

version 0.40

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Fey::Object::Iterator::FromSelect::Caching;

  my $iter = Fey::Object::Iterator::FromSelect::Caching->new(
      classes     => 'MyApp::User',
      select      => $select,
      dbh         => $dbh,
      bind_params => \@bind,
  );

  print $iter->index();    # 0

  while ( my $user = $iter->next() ) {
      print $iter->index();    # 1, 2, 3, ...
      print $user->username();
  }

  # will return cached objects now
  $iter->reset();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements a caching subclass of
L<Fey::Object::Iterator::FromSelect::FromSelect>. This means that it caches
objects it creates internally. When C<< $iterator->reset() >> is
called it will re-use those objects before fetching more data from the
DBMS.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following methods:

=head2 $iterator->reset()

Resets the iterator so that the next call to C<< $iterator->next() >>
returns the first objects. Internally, this I<does not> reset the
L<DBI> statement handle, it simply makes the iterator use cached
objects.

=head2 $iterator->clone()

Clones the iterator while sharing its cached data with the original
object. This is really intended for internal use, so I<use at your own
risk>.

=head1 ROLES

This class does the L<Fey::ORM::Role::Iterator> role.
