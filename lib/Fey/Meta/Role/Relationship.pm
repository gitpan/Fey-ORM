=head1 NAME

Fey::Meta::Role::Relationship - A shared role for all foreign HasX metaclasses

=head1 VERSION

This role provides shared functionality for has-one and has-many
metaclasses. See the relevant classes for documentation.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR OPTIONS

This role adds the following constructor options:

=item * name

The name of the relationship. This will be used as the name for any
attribute or method created by this metaclass.

This defaults to C<< lc $self->foreign_table()->name() >>.

=item * table

The (source) table of the foreign key.

=item * foreign_table
